## GPG

### Integrity Check - Verifying the File's Signature

If you already have a trusted version of GnuPG installed, you can check the supplied signature.  For example, to check the signature of the file gnupg-2.0.30.tar.bz2, you can use this command: 

    gpg --verify gnupg-2.0.30.tar.bz2.sig gnupg-2.0.30.tar.bz2

Note: you should never use a GnuPG version you just downloaded to check the integrity of the source â€” use an existing, trusted GnuPG installation, e.g., the one provided by your distribution. 
If the output of the above command is similar to the following, then either you don't have our distribution keys (our signing keys are here) or the signature was generated by someone else and the file should be treated suspiciously. 
 
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    gpg: Signature made Fri 09 Oct 2015 05:41:55 PM CEST using RSA key ID 4F25E3B6
    gpg: Can't check signature: No public key
    gpg: Signature made Tue 13 Oct 2015 10:18:01 AM CEST using RSA key ID 33BD3F06
    gpg: Can't check signature: No public key
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you instead see: 
 
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    gpg: Good signature from "Werner Koch (dist sig)" [unknown]
    gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
    gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
    Primary key fingerprint: D869 2123 C406 5DEA 5E0F  3AB5 249B 39D2 4F25 E3B6
    gpg: Signature made Tue 13 Oct 2015 10:18:01 AM CEST using RSA key ID 33BD3F06
    gpg: Good signature from "NIIBE Yutaka (GnuPG Release Key) <gniibe@fsij.org>" [unknown]
    gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
    gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
    Primary key fingerprint: 031E C253 6E58 0D8E A286  A9F2 2071 B08A 33BD 3F06
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


then you have a copy of our keys and the signatures are valid, but either you have not marked the keys as trusted or the keys are a forgery.  In this case, at the very least, you should compare the fingerprints that are shown to those on the signing keys page.  Even better is to compare the fingerprints with those shown on our business cards, which we handout at events that we attend. 
Ideally, you'll see something like: 
 
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    gpg: Signature made Fri 09 Oct 2015 05:41:55 PM CEST using RSA key ID 4F25E3B6
    gpg: Good signature from "Werner Koch (dist sig)" [full]
    gpg: Signature made Tue 13 Oct 2015 10:18:01 AM CEST using RSA key ID 33BD3F06
    gpg: Good signature from "NIIBE Yutaka (GnuPG Release Key) <gniibe@fsij.org>" [full]
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This means that the signature is valid and that you trust this key (either you signed it or someone you trusted did). 

### Comparing Checksums
If you are not able to use an old version of GnuPG, you can still verify the file's SHA-1 checksum.  This is less secure, because if someone modified the files as they were transferred to you, it would not be much more effort to modify the checksums that you see on this webpage.  As such, if you use this method, you should compare the checksums with those in release announcement.  This is sent to the gnupg-announce mailing list (among others), which is widely mirrored.  Don't use the mailing list archive on this website, but find the announcement on several other websites and make sure the checksum is consistent.  This makes it more difficult for an attacker to trick you into installing a modified version of the software. 
Assuming you downloaded the file gnupg-2.0.30.tar.bz2, you can run the sha1sum command like this: 
 
    sha1sum gnupg-2.0.30.tar.bz2

and check that the output matches the SHA-1 checksum reported on this site. An example of a sha1sum output is:
